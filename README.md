## Snack Hub Nagpur
The website, available at https://snack-hub-nagpur.netlify.app/, serves the purpose of providing valuable information to customers regarding the quality, quantity, and cost of various food items. It proves to be a convenient platform for street food enthusiasts as they can directly place their orders without relying on intermediary applications such as Zomato or Swiggy. The website features a collection of images and a set of genuine Q&A, which greatly assist customers in gaining a comprehensive understanding of the shop.

This website was developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Its creation was motivated by the desire to participate in an intercollegiate website showcase competition, with the primary objective being the advertisement of the Snacks Hub Shop situated in Sadar, Nagpur.

If you have any inquiries regarding the website or any related matters, please do not hesitate to reach me. Thank you.ðŸ˜Š
